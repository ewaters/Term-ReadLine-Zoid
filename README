Term-ReadLine-Zoid 0.07
=======================

ABOUT

  This package provides a set of modules that form an interactive input buffer
  written in plain perl with minimal dependencies. It features almost all
  key-bindings described in the posix spec for the sh(1) utility with some
  extensions like multiline editing; this includes a vi-command mode with a
  save-buffer (for copy-pasting) and an undo-stack.

  It is compatible with the Term::ReadLine interface, so it
  can be used with perl programs using this interface.

DEPENDENCIES

  The only real dependencies for this package are Term::ReadKey and AutoLoader
  which are available from cpan.

  One function in the vi command mode needs File::Temp, but as long as you don't
  use this function you don't need the module.

  You might also want to consider to install Env::PS1 if you want a fancy prompt.

INSTALL

  Try something like:

    $ perl Build.PL
    $ ./Build test
    $ ./Build install

  See the Module::Build documentation for advanced build options.
